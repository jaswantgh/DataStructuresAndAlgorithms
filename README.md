# Bushfire Monitoring System

This system implements various algorithms and abstract data types (ADTs) to monitor bushfires in specific areas using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It is developed in Python 2.7.17 and is based on data obtained from the 'location.txt' and 'UAVdata.txt' text files.

The data comprises of information on location, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It is used to prioritize areas with a high risk of bushfires, requiring significant attention due to severe weather conditions.

Throughout the project, we have employed data structures like graphs, hash tables, heaps, stacks, queues, and linked lists. Additionally, we have implemented algorithms like BFS, DFS, and Greedy Best-First Search. Other operations such as insert, delete, and search operations, data hashing, heap structuring, and itinerary provision are also included.

# Data Files
